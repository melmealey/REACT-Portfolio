      <p>

      After completing her Bachelorâ€™s degree in Recreation Management and Youth Leadership, she
chose to raise a family. While absent from the workforce, she used her knowledge, skills and
experiences in a number of volunteer capacities; such as teaching children and youth, leading a
cub scout den and coordinating compassionate service opportunities with members of her
congregation to ensure struggling families had needs met.
<br />
<br />

Over an 8 year period, she grew and managed a personal business as an independent sales
consultant for Norwex. Through these opportunities, she learned how to interact and work well with
a diverse group of people with varying needs. In addition, she cultivated her ability for organization
and refined collaboration strategies to help others achieve short and long-term financial goals. 
This included working hard toward a professional goal and earning an all-inclusive trip to
Cancun in October 2021.

Mel is an avid learner and can adapt to new challenges quickly. Recently, she has worked as an office manager for a pediatric dental practice while finishing her certification in Web Development.
