          After completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Recreation Management and Youth Leadership, I chose to raise a family. While absent from the workforce, I used my knowledge, skills and experiences in a number of volunteer capacities; such as teaching children and youth, leading a cub scout den and coordinating compassionate service opportunities with members of my congregation to ensure struggling families had needs met.

          Over an 8 year period, I grew and managed a personal business as an independent sales consultant for Norwex. Through these opportunities, I learned how to interact and work well with a diverse group of people with varying needs. In addition, I cultivated my ability for organization and refined collaboration strategies to help others achieve short and long-term financial goals. This included working hard toward a professional goal and earning an all-inclusive trip to Cancun in October 2021.

          I am an avid learner and can adapt to new challenges quickly. Recently, I have worked as an office manager for a pediatric dental practice while finishing my certification in Web Development.
