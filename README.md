# Description
I used React, React router and Vite to showcase my work as a web developer. This is a single-page application sharing about me, a few work projects, my resume and a contact form.

# Intallation
`npm install`
* npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
* https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
`npm i react-router-dom`
`npm i @emailjs/browser`

`npm run dev`
  

# Usage
The page will load to About Me as a Home page. Click each of the Navigation tabs to move from page to page. Portfolio showcases 6 of my favorite projects with a link to their deployed site (or video walkthroughs) as well as a link to the code on Github for each. You can contact me using the contact form, or get in touch on social media.
